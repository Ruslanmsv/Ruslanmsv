### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ruslan! 

For the last 7+ years, I've worked as a Project and Product Manager, of which four years I've worked at Yandex Maps.

Last year I spent updating my web dev knowledge of JS, TS, React, Astro, Next, Tailwind, tRPC, and Prisma. 

I've started building my portfolio, which you can see in pinned repositories. It mainly consists of projects from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), and I want to find an SWE job with more meaningful projects, to work on! 

I assess my web dev knowledge as between Junior++ and Middle. However, I have a lot of experience from product and managerial perspectives in organizations ranging in size from 30 to 15k+ people.
